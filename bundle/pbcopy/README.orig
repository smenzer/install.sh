== pbcopy.vim - vim interaction with the Mac OS X pasteboard

This is a tiny plugin to enable communication with the Mac
OS X pasteboard from Vim when running inside a program (such
as tmux) which cannot directly interact with the pbcopy
command.

== HOW TO

# Make sure 'remote login' is enabled under Sharing in
  System Preferences
# Yank or delete some text using normal vim commands
# Call :PBCopy
# Paste into your favourite OS X application

== KNOWN ISSUES/TODO

* Add support for pasting from the pasteboard into vim

== ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

* Seth Milliken (@sethmilliken) who told me about the
  workaround. All I've done is take his code snipper and
  make a plugin from it.
