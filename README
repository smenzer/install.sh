configuration for terminal including vim, screen, and tmux settings

some files will need to be setup as symbolic links in the user's root (~username)

  - .bash_profile -> terminal/.bash_profile_<computer name>
  - .vim -> terminal/
  - .vimrc -> terminal/.vimrc
  - .tmux.conf -> terminal/.tmux.conf
